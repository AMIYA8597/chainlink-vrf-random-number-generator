# Compile contracts

# Deploy contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

























I'll guide you through each step:

1. First, let's make sure you have a proper subscription ID. Let's go through the VRF subscription setup:

```bash
# Go to: https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia
# Connect your wallet
# Click "Create Subscription"
# Fund it with LINK (you'll need some LINK tokens)
```

2. After getting your subscription ID, update your .env file:

```plaintext
# Network URLs
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/nq4aXVDUYL_DrVbl4OOZOgwhqG_YenRB

# Keys
PRIVATE_KEY=6e65652e5cf6f9f6a15a7638d64dfd1a072305db1d95e24a333cbc7dd2f1cd8f

# Chainlink VRF
VRF_COORDINATOR=0x8103B0A8A00be2DDC778e6e7eaa21791Cd364625
KEY_HASH=0x474e34a077df58807dbe9c96d3c009b23b3c6d0cce433e59bbf5b34f823bc56c

# Add your new subscription ID here after creating it
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your_new_subscription_id

```

3. Create a deployment script (`scripts/deploy.js`):




4. Create a script to generate random numbers (`scripts/generateNumber.js`):



Now, let's execute everything step by step:

1. **Create VRF Subscription**:
```bash
# Go to https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia
# Connect wallet
# Click "Create Subscription"
# Save the subscription ID
# Fund with LINK tokens (at least 2-3 LINK)
```

2. **Update .env file** with your subscription ID

3. **Deploy the contract**:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

4. **Add Consumer**:
- Go back to https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia
- Find your subscription
- Click "Add Consumer"
- Enter the deployed contract address

5. **Generate Random Number**:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/generateNumber.js --network sepolia
```

Important Notes:
1. Make sure you have:
   - Sepolia ETH for gas (get from Sepolia faucet)
   - LINK tokens for VRF (get from Chainlink faucet)
   - Added the contract as a consumer in VRF subscription
   - Funded the VRF subscription with LINK

2. The random number generation takes a few minutes because:
   - First transaction needs to be confirmed
   - Chainlink VRF needs to process the request
   - Second transaction (callback) needs to be confirmed

Would you like me to help you with any specific step? Or shall we start with creating the VRF subscription?



















Yes, let's create your VRF subscription step by step. I'll guide you through the process:

1. First, go to the Chainlink VRF page:
- Visit https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia

2. Connect your wallet:
- Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner
- Select MetaMask (or your preferred wallet)
- Make sure you're on Sepolia network
- Use the same wallet address that matches the PRIVATE_KEY in your .env file

3. Create a new subscription:
- Click the "Create Subscription" button
- Confirm the transaction in your wallet
- Wait for the transaction to be confirmed

4. Fund your subscription:
- You need LINK tokens for this. Let's get some first:
  - Go to https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia
  - Connect your wallet
  - Request both LINK and ETH

5. After getting LINK tokens:
- Go back to https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia
- Find your subscription in the list
- Click "Add Funds"
- Add at least 2-3 LINK tokens
- Confirm the transaction

6. Once your subscription is created and funded:
- You'll see a subscription ID (a number)
- Copy this number
- Update your .env file with this subscription ID

Let me know once you've connected your wallet to the VRF page and we can proceed with creating the subscription. Do you need help with:
1. Switching to Sepolia network in MetaMask?
2. Getting LINK tokens from the faucet?
3. Or any other part of this process?

Also, please let me know if you run into any errors or if something doesn't look right!
